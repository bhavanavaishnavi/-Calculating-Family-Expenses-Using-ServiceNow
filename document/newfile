Calculating Family Expenses Using ServiceNow
1. Introduction
Managing household expenses manually can lead to errors, lack of tracking, and financial mismanagement. 
The project “Calculating Family Expenses Using ServiceNow” is designed to create a structured and automated expense management system using the ServiceNow platform.
This system allows users to record daily expenses and automatically calculate consolidated family expenses using table relationships and business rules. 
The project demonstrates how ServiceNow can be customized to build real-world business applications beyond IT Service Management (ITSM).
